# Sentinel Ops — Installer & Deployment

An installation and update system for the Sentinel Ops stack: self-hosted
**Supabase**, **Logflare**, and the **Sentinel Ops React frontend**, all running
under Docker.

A shell installer for Linux servers. A clean supported server plus a deployment
key becomes a working Sentinel Ops
installation with one command, and every subsequent release ships with
`sentinel-ops update app`.

---

## Quick start

Before you begin you need an **SSH deploy key** for the private Sentinel Ops
application repository, and DNS for your two hostnames already pointing at this
server. See [Before you install](#before-you-install).

### One-liner

Run this from a directory containing your `deploy_key`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrainStation-23/SentinelOps-installer/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

It downloads the installer, reattaches your terminal so the guided prompts still
work, and starts the installation.

### From a clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrainStation-23/SentinelOps-installer.git
cd SentinelOps-installer
cp /path/to/deploy_key ./deploy_key      # private SSH key for the app repo
chmod 600 ./deploy_key
sudo ./install.sh
```

After installation the `sentinel-ops` command is on `PATH`:

```bash
sentinel-ops                 # guided menu
sentinel-ops status          # what is actually running
sentinel-ops credentials     # generated Supabase credentials
```

### Non-interactive (CI, image bakes)

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --yes
```

`--yes` accepts every default. The endpoint defaults are **localhost** — a
non-interactive run produces a deployment that works on that host and nowhere
else. To serve it under a real domain, write `config/installer.env` first, or
install once interactively and copy that file to the next server.

---

## Before you install

**Server:** Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Debian, or RHEL/CentOS/Fedora. At least **4 GB
RAM** — the Supabase stack runs a dozen containers — and 20 GB of disk. Root or
sudo.

**Deploy key.** The application repository is private. Register an SSH deploy key
on it and put the **private** key (not the `.pub`) where the installer looks:

```
./deploy_key                        next to the installer, or the directory you run it from
/opt/sentinel-ops/deploy_key
/opt/sentinel-ops/config/deploy_key
```

```bash
chmod 600 deploy_key
```

Place it **before** running — it is needed partway through, after Supabase comes
up.

**DNS.** Only needed if you are serving this under a domain rather than on
localhost. Point both hostnames at this server before installing, so your
reverse proxy can obtain certificates:

```bash
dig +short app.your-domain.tld
dig +short supabase.your-domain.tld
```

**Firewall.** Nothing in this stack should be publicly exposed except through
your reverse proxy:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

> Supabase's compose file publishes Kong on `0.0.0.0:8000`. The `default deny
> incoming` rule above is what keeps it off the internet — do not skip it.

**Reverse proxy.** The installer does not install one. Point yours at the
upstreams it prints — see [docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md](docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md).

**No reverse proxy yet, or testing on a private network?** `sentinel-ops
network enable` binds the frontend to every interface (Supabase's gateway
already does — upstream's own default) and opens both ports in `ufw`/`firewalld`
if one is active. There is no TLS on either port this way; `sentinel-ops
network disable` reverts the frontend to loopback-only at any time. See
`sentinel-ops network status`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sentinel-ops` | Guided menu; detects whether an installation exists |
| `sentinel-ops install` | First installation |
| `sentinel-ops update app` | Update the application only *(the common case)* |
| `sentinel-ops update supabase` | Update Supabase only |
| `sentinel-ops update all` | Update Supabase, then the application |
| `sentinel-ops status` | Health and version of every component |
| `sentinel-ops credentials` | Show generated credentials (masked; `--show` to reveal) |
| `sentinel-ops backup [create\|list]` | Database backups |
| `sentinel-ops restore [backup]` | Restore a backup (latest if omitted) |
| `sentinel-ops rollback` | Roll the application back to the previous image |
| `sentinel-ops logs <target>` | `app`, `supabase`, `logflare`, `installer` |
| `sentinel-ops network [status\|enable\|disable]` | Expose (or restrict) the frontend and Supabase API directly on the network |
| `sentinel-ops azure [status\|enable\|disable]` | Configure Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID) sign-in |
| `sentinel-ops nuke` | **Destroy this installation** so a fresh one can be tested |

Global options: `--dir <path>`, `--yes`, `--show`, `--force`, `--debug`.

### Testing a fresh install on the same machine

`sentinel-ops nuke` is the counterpart to `install`: it removes the containers,
**all volumes including the database**, the application images and the
installation directory, leaving the host ready to install from scratch.

```bash
sudo sentinel-ops nuke                    # everything
sudo sentinel-ops nuke --keep-config      # keep installer.env and the deploy key
sudo sentinel-ops nuke --keep-backups     # keep the database dumps
sudo sentinel-ops nuke --keep-all         # keep both
```

It asks you to type `nuke` to confirm. `--yes` skips that prompt for scripted
test loops; without a terminal and without `--yes` the command **refuses and
exits 2** rather than assuming an answer, so `nuke && install.sh` can never
install over a stack that is still running.

Supabase's pulled images are deliberately left on the host — re-pulling them is
several GB per cycle, and a cached image cannot make an install stale. `docker`
itself is a prerequisite, not part of the deployment, and is never touched.

`--keep-config` is the one to use for repeat runs: it preserves
`config/installer.env` and `config/deploy_key`, so the reinstall needs no
prompts and no re-copied key. Phase markers in `.state/` are always removed, so
every phase genuinely re-runs.

---

## Supported systems

| Family | Distributions |
|---|---|
| Debian | Debian, Ubuntu (and derivatives via `ID_LIKE`) |
| RHEL | RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Rocky, AlmaLinux |

The installer refuses to run on a non-Linux kernel. Prerequisites — `curl`,
`git`, `openssl`, `jq`, `ssh` — are verified and installed when missing.

Docker is checked at three levels, because `docker --version` succeeding proves
nothing: the **binary** exists, the **daemon** answers, and a **container
actually runs**.

## Runtime architecture

```
                Internet
                   │
                   ▼
          your reverse proxy          ← you manage this
              ┌────┴─────┐
              ▼          ▼
      127.0.0.1:8000   127.0.0.1:3000
      Supabase gateway  Sentinel Ops frontend
              │        (Node, Nitro SSR server)
              ▼
         PostgreSQL ──► Logflare / vector
```

**No reverse proxy is installed.** TLS, certificates and routing stay with the
host, to be handled however that host already does it. The installer's job is to
expose two stable upstreams and tell you what they are:

| Upstream | Default |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `127.0.0.1:3000` |
| Supabase API (Kong) | `127.0.0.1:8000` |

Both bind to **loopback only** (`APP_BIND`), so a proxy on this host reaches
them and the public internet does not. Supabase's own Kong gateway is left in
place rather than duplicated.

See [docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md](docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md) for nginx, Caddy and Traefik
examples, and the WebSocket/upload-size gotchas worth knowing about.

---

## What is safe across updates

`sentinel-ops update app` never touches Supabase's version, secrets,
configuration or volumes. `sentinel-ops update supabase` refreshes the
deployment scaffolding and images while preserving:

- `supabase/.env` — secrets are generated once and never regenerated
- `supabase/volumes/db/data` — the database
- `supabase/volumes/storage` — uploaded objects
- `supabase/volumes/functions` — deployed edge functions

A database backup is **mandatory** before a Supabase update; the update aborts
if the backup fails.

---

## Idempotency

Every expensive installation phase is guarded by a marker in `.state/phases/`.
If an install fails at the frontend build, fixing the problem and re-running
resumes from there: Supabase is not reinstalled, secrets are not regenerated,
volumes are not deleted and the repository is not re-cloned. `--force` re-runs
completed phases deliberately.

---

## Deployment safety

Application updates never destroy the running deployment before the replacement
is proven:

```
build new image (tagged :<git-sha>)
      ↓
verify it on a staging container
      ↓
run migrations, deploy functions
      ↓
swap the live container
      ↓
health check ──fail──► automatic rollback to the previous image
```

Images are tagged `sentinel-ops:<git-sha>` as well as `:latest`, so there is
always a known-good image to roll back to.

`sentinel-ops rollback` restores the previous image and commit. It deliberately
does **not** revert database migrations — silently reversing schema is more
destructive than leaving it — and names the relevant backup instead.

---

## Secrets

- Secrets are generated by Supabase's own setup, or by the installer on the
  fallback path. They are **never** requested from the operator, with one
  exception: an Azure AD client secret, if you choose to enable that sign-in
  provider, is a real external credential and has to come from you — see
  [Azure AD sign-in](#azure-ad-sign-in) below. It is entered with the terminal
  echo off, written only to `supabase/.env`, and never logged.
- Nothing secret is printed during installation or written to installer logs.
  `sentinel-ops credentials` is the one disclosure point, masked by default.
- The **service-role key is never given to the frontend**. Only the publishable
  (anon) key reaches the build, because anything in a Vite bundle is shipped to
  the browser.
- `config/deploy_key` is `chmod 600`, used only via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, and
  excluded from the Docker build context.

---

## Analytics (Logflare)

Deployed via Supabase's own optional overlay (`run.sh config add logs`), which
adds the **analytics** and **vector** services on the Postgres backend. That
overlay is the only path: if the Supabase release in use does not ship it,
analytics is **skipped with a warning** and the install continues. There is no
parallel compose stack to fall back to, because a log aggregator is not worth a
second deployment mechanism to keep in sync.

Tokens and the base64 `LOGFLARE_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are generated once and
re-applied after every Supabase update. Port 4000 is never published — Logflare's
dashboard has no authentication of its own.

Full detail in [docs/LOGFLARE.md](docs/LOGFLARE.md).

---

## Azure AD sign-in

Off by default. `sentinel-ops azure enable` (or the install-time prompt) asks
for the Entra ID application's Client ID, client secret and, optionally, a
tenant ID, then wires Supabase Auth (`gotrue`) to accept it — including
uncommenting the `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_AZURE_*` lines in `docker-compose.yml`, which
upstream ships disabled and which setting `.env` alone does not turn on.

The redirect URI to register on the app registration is
`<API_EXTERNAL_URL>/callback`, printed by `sentinel-ops azure status` and by
the install summary when enabled at install time. Re-applied automatically
after `sentinel-ops update supabase`, which otherwise resets the compose file
to upstream's commented-out default. Full detail in
[docs/AZURE-AD.md](docs/AZURE-AD.md).

## Frontend build

The default build mode is **`docker`**: dependency install and the build run
inside a multi-stage image, so the server needs no JavaScript toolchain and the
build is reproducible.

Dependencies are installed from whichever lockfile the repository actually
maintains — `bun.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, then `package-lock.json`,
most specific first — and always from the lock rather than resolving afresh. The
builder is `node:22-alpine`, which several of the application's dependencies
require.

The application is a **TanStack Start / Nitro** app: it server-renders its HTML,
so there is no static bundle to host. The build pins Nitro's `node-server`
preset (the repository targets `netlify`; the override applies inside the build
layer only) and the runtime image runs `node .output/server/index.mjs` as an
unprivileged user — no source, no `node_modules`, no build toolchain.

`assets/app/Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` belong in the application
repository. Until they are committed there, the installer copies its own
templates into the checkout; a `Dockerfile` already present in the repo always
wins.

---

## Updating the installer itself

The one-liner always installs whatever is on `main`. To install from a branch:

```bash
SENTINEL_OPS_INSTALLER_BRANCH=my-branch   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrainStation-23/SentinelOps-installer/my-branch/install.sh | sudo -E bash
```

`sudo -E` preserves the variable. On an existing server, pulling a newer
installer and re-running `sudo ./install.sh` is safe — completed phases are
skipped.

---

## Development

```bash
./tests/run.sh
```

Runs shell syntax checks, a CRLF guard, shellcheck (when installed) and the unit
tests for the helpers that the deployment logic depends on.

> **Line endings:** these scripts must ship with LF, which matters if you edit
> them from a Windows checkout. `.gitattributes` enforces it; `install.sh` also
> refuses to run a CRLF-contaminated checkout rather than failing with an
> unhelpful `bad interpreter` error.

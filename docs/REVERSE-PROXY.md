# Reverse proxy

The installer does **not** install or manage a reverse proxy. TLS termination,
certificates and routing are the host's responsibility, to be handled however
that host already does it.

## Moving to a real domain

The recommended first step, once you have a hostname and a proxy in mind, is:

```bash
sudo sentinel-ops domain set app.example.com
```

This does everything a domain move needs in one config change plus a
restart - **no reinstall, no rebuild, no data loss**:

- sets `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, `API_EXTERNAL_URL` and `SITE_URL` to
  `https://app.example.com`
- adds it to `ADDITIONAL_REDIRECT_URLS` so auth redirects keep working
- flips `APP_BIND` back to `127.0.0.1` (a domain implies a proxy in front, so
  direct exposure is no longer wanted - see
  [DECISIONS.md #7](DECISIONS.md#7-no-reverse-proxy-is-installed))
- persists both to `config/installer.env` and `supabase/.env`, then restarts
  Kong, Auth and the frontend so they pick up the new URLs

Run `sentinel-ops domain status` at any time to see which mode (loopback, LAN
or domain) is currently active. This replaces hand-editing
`config/installer.env` - do that only for settings `domain set` does not
cover.

What it does **not** do is register DNS or run a proxy: point `app.example.com`
at this server yourself, and see the worked configurations below (Zoraxy,
nginx, Caddy, Traefik) for the proxy
that terminates TLS and forwards to the two upstreams `domain set` just
printed.

What the installer guarantees regardless of mode is a stable pair of
upstreams to point at.

## The two upstreams

```bash
sentinel-ops status     # prints both under "URLs"
```

| Upstream | Default | What it serves |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `127.0.0.1:41820` | The React application (Node running the Nitro SSR server) |
| Supabase API | `127.0.0.1:8000` | Kong — REST, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions, Studio |

A fresh install binds both to every interface (`APP_BIND=0.0.0.0`) so the LAN
can reach them with zero manual config - see [DECISIONS.md
#7](DECISIONS.md#7-no-reverse-proxy-is-installed) and `sentinel-ops network
status`. Once you put a proxy in front with `sentinel-ops domain set`,
`APP_BIND` goes back to **loopback only**: the proxy on this host reaches
them, the public internet does not.

```
        Internet
           │
           ▼
   your reverse proxy          ← you manage this
      ┌────┴─────┐
      ▼          ▼
 127.0.0.1:41820  127.0.0.1:8000
   frontend        Supabase Kong
```

### If the proxy runs elsewhere

Set `APP_BIND=0.0.0.0` in `config/installer.env` and re-run
`sentinel-ops update app`, or use `sentinel-ops network enable`, which does
the same bind change and also opens the frontend port in `ufw`/`firewalld` if
one is active. If no firewall is enforcing anything on this host, **firewall
the port yourself** — nothing else will.

### If the proxy runs in Docker

The frontend container joins the Supabase Docker network, so a proxy container
on that same network can route to it by name instead of through the host:

```bash
docker network connect "$(docker inspect -f \
  '{{range $k,$v := .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{$k}}{{end}}' supabase-db)" my-proxy
```

Then use `sentinel-ops-frontend:41820` and `kong:8000` as the upstreams.

## Example configurations

These are references, not managed files. Adapt them to your setup.

Whichever proxy you use, check it once it is up:

```bash
sudo sentinel-ops domain status
```

Under **Uploads** it reports the upload limit Storage advertises, both directly
and through your proxy, and pushes one 6 MiB upload chunk through the proxy to
confirm it is not refused. A `413` there means the proxy caps request bodies
below what the App Catalog sends - see [Upload size](#things-that-will-bite-you).

### Zoraxy

Zoraxy is what we usually run in front of Sentinel Ops, and it needs the least
configuration: it streams request bodies to the upstream with **no size limit**,
upgrades WebSockets (Realtime) on its own, and sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which
Storage uses to build the upload URLs it hands back to the browser.

Create two rules with **Create Proxy Rule**:

| Matching Keyword / Domain | Target | Remote Target Require TLS |
|---|---|---|
| `app.sentinelops.com` | `127.0.0.1:41820` | off |
| `supabase.sentinelops.com` | `127.0.0.1:8000` | off |

Issue the certificates under **TLS / SSL certificates** (ACME), and turn on
**Force redirect HTTP request to HTTPS** on the listener.

Things to leave alone:

- **Don't start Zoraxy with a non-zero `-writetimeout`.** The default, `0`, is
  what lets a long upload or a Realtime connection run as long as it needs to.
- **Per-rule rate limiting** on the Supabase rule, if you turn it on, must stay
  well above the upload rate: TUS sends one request per 6 MiB, and the
  application itself makes many small requests per page. 100 req/s is a
  reasonable floor.

For `sentinel-ops auth enable rate-limit` (see
[AUTH-HARDENING.md](AUTH-HARDENING.md)), add a custom header to the Supabase
rule (**Edit Custom Header**): direction *to upstream*, name
`X-Sentinel-Client-IP`, value `$remote_ip`. If Zoraxy itself sits behind
another proxy or a CDN, `$remote_ip` is that hop's address, not the user's -
set the header at the outermost proxy instead.

### nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name app.sentinelops.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.sentinelops.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.sentinelops.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:41820;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name supabase.sentinelops.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/supabase.sentinelops.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/supabase.sentinelops.com/privkey.pem;

    # Storage enforces its own upload limit (4 GiB by default); nginx's 1 MB
    # default would refuse the very first 6 MiB upload chunk with a 413.
    client_max_body_size 0;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Realtime uses WebSockets.
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade    $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    }

    # Resumable (TUS) uploads: stream each chunk to Storage as it arrives
    # instead of spooling it to disk first.
    location /storage/v1/upload/resumable {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }
}
```

#### Sign-in rate limiting (optional)

Pairs with `sentinel-ops auth enable rate-limit` (see
[AUTH-HARDENING.md](AUTH-HARDENING.md)). Add the client-IP header to the
Supabase server block above. It must be `proxy_set_header`, which
**overwrites** whatever the client sent; an appended header can be spoofed.
A second, coarser per-IP limit on the password-grant endpoint at the edge
costs nothing:

```nginx
# http {} context
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=auth_token:10m rate=10r/m;

# inside the supabase.sentinelops.com server {} block
    proxy_set_header X-Sentinel-Client-IP $remote_addr;   # in location / too

    location = /auth/v1/token {
        limit_req zone=auth_token burst=5 nodelay;
        limit_req_status 429;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host                 $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP            $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For      $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto    $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Sentinel-Client-IP $remote_addr;
    }
```

`/auth/v1/token` also serves session refreshes, so leave enough headroom for
several users behind one NAT. This adds a limit at the proxy. It does not
replace gotrue's own limit, which keys on the header.

### Caddy

```caddyfile
app.sentinelops.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:41820
    encode gzip zstd
}

supabase.sentinelops.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
    encode gzip zstd
}
```

Caddy has no request body limit by default, and Storage enforces its own. If you
add a `request_body { max_size … }` block, keep it at or above the Storage
limit (`4GB`).

### Traefik (dynamic file provider)

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    sentinel-app:
      rule: "Host(`app.sentinelops.com`)"
      service: sentinel-app
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
    sentinel-supabase:
      rule: "Host(`supabase.sentinelops.com`)"
      service: sentinel-supabase
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
  services:
    sentinel-app:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://127.0.0.1:41820"
    sentinel-supabase:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
```

Traefik has no request body limit by default. If you attach a `buffering`
middleware to the Supabase router, its `maxRequestBodyBytes` must allow at
least one 6 MiB upload chunk - or leave buffering off that router entirely.

---

## Things that will bite you

**WebSockets.** Supabase Realtime needs `Upgrade`/`Connection` headers and a
long read timeout. Without them Realtime silently fails to connect while
everything else looks fine.

**Upload size.** App Catalog installers (a Homebrew `.pkg` is ~120 MB) are
uploaded with TUS in 6 MiB chunks, so the proxy has to accept at least one
~7 MiB request body. nginx defaults to 1 MB and answers with a confusing HTML
413; Zoraxy, Caddy and Traefik have no limit unless you add one. Separately,
Storage has its own limit: upstream Supabase ships 50 MiB, and the installer
raises it to 4 GiB with a generated overlay,
`supabase/docker-compose.sentinel-storage.yml` (change it with
`STORAGE_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` in `config/installer.env`, then
`sentinel-ops repair apply`). `sentinel-ops status` shows the limit Storage
actually advertises; `sentinel-ops domain status` also tests the proxy.

**nginx must speak HTTP/1.1 to Supabase.** nginx proxies with HTTP/1.0 unless
told otherwise, and current Supabase releases put Envoy in front of the stack,
which answers HTTP/1.0 with `426 Upgrade Required` - on every route, not just
Realtime. Keep `proxy_http_version 1.1;` in every `location` that points at
`127.0.0.1:8000`.

**Slow uplinks.** Supabase's gateway gives each request to Storage 30 seconds.
A 6 MiB chunk therefore needs roughly 2 Mbit/s of upload bandwidth; slower
links fail mid-upload whatever the proxy allows.

**The URLs come from runtime env vars, not the bundle.** The app reads
`SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL` from `process.env` at runtime via
`/runtime-config.js`, so the domains must match `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL` in
`config/installer.env`. Changing a domain only needs the container restarted
with the new value (`sentinel-ops update app` does this), not a rebuild — but
it still needs the container, not just the proxy, reloaded.

**Do not expose Logflare.** Its `/dashboard` has no authentication of its own.
Port 4000 is not published by default — keep it that way.

**Studio.** Reached through the Supabase hostname and protected by
`DASHBOARD_USERNAME` / `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` (see `sentinel-ops credentials`).
That is HTTP basic auth, so consider restricting it by IP at the proxy too.

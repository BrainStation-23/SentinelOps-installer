# By default the frontend binds to 127.0.0.1 (APP_BIND) and is reachable only
# through whatever reverse proxy the operator puts in front of it. Supabase's
# own compose file is different: its gateway publishes to every interface
# unconditionally (upstream's own choice, not this installer's), so the host
# firewall is the only thing standing between it and the internet - see the
# README's "Firewall" section.
#
# A fresh install defaults to LAN exposure: SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL, API_EXTERNAL_URL
# and SITE_URL are seeded from this host's own LAN IP address (see
# detect_lan_ip() in lib/common.sh), and the firewall rule that opens the
# ports is scoped to RFC1918 ranges (see FIREWALL_PRIVATE_RANGES in
# lib/firewall.sh) rather than to the world. That is enough for an operator on
# the same network to reach the install with zero manual configuration, without
# also handing it to the public internet. There is still no TLS on either
# port - moving to a real domain is `sentinel-ops domain set <hostname>`,
# which puts a proxy in front instead (see docs/REVERSE-PROXY.md).

# APP_BRANCH is the single setting both `update app` and the auto-update timer
# follow, so switching branches is a config change plus an ordinary update:
# repo_update checks the new branch out and the usual backup, migrations and
# staged deploy run against it. Nothing here touches the stack directly.
#
# The one thing an update cannot undo is the schema. Migrations are only ever
# applied forward, so moving to a branch that does not contain what is
# deployed (dev back to main, say) leaves the database ahead of the code. That
# case is detected up front and has to be confirmed.
# shellcheck shell=bash

# A name Git accepts as a branch, and that cannot be mistaken for an option.
